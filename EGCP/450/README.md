This folder is for EGCP 450 Embedded Processor Interfacing: Using the Motorola 68HC12 microcontroller, and the 
Dragon 12 board. CodeWarrior IDE 5.1 was used with absolute Assembly. 

Lab 1 and 2 are not included (trivial)

Lab 3 is a 4-key digital lock, also with a 7 segment display, on or off.

Lab 4 is using the PWM and Input Capture abilities of the Dragon 12 board to measure a generated signal.

Lab 5 is a continuation of lab 4. Using the Input/Output Compare and the Pulse Accumulators to measure a generated signal.

Lab 6 is exploring FSMs. Part 1 is creating a Traffic stop (Moore FSM), part 2 is simulating a robot, and its emotions (Mealy FSM).
